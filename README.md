I am Alv, a software engineer and former Phd student in Computer Science. 
I am passioned about Zero Knowledge / Succint proofs, where I was previously researching, nonetheless I am more of a builder 👷 than a man of science 🧑‍🔬. 
For this reasons I am currently studying full-time zk-SNARKs and rusting off my rust skills, with the hopes of getting a job in the industry 🤞
